# Lime.js Blackjack

This is just a fast implementation of blackjack that I made in order
to experiment with
[lime.js](http://www.limejs.com/)
and
[Google Closure](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/?csw=1)
. I'm sure there are bugs
but it is good enough for my purposes.

You can see it in action at
